  <s>My Neck is Thinner than a Hair: Engines is an integral part of a larger, ongoing series by The Atlas Group, a project established by the artist Walid Raad in 1999. The Atlas Group has concentrated on researching and recording the contemporary history of Lebanon. To this end, it locates, preserves, studies and produces audio, visual, literary, and other artifacts that relate to that era. It has built up archives of notebooks, films, videotapes, photographs, and other objects, which are kept in New York City and Beirut. When presented to the public, these archives take the form of mixed media installations, single-channel screenings, lectures and performances, and visual and literary essays.
    The Atlas Group archives are organized in three categories of files: Type A (authored), Type FD (found), and Type AGP (Atlas Group Productions), reflecting the character of the project, which oscillates between fiction and non-fiction. The documents, stories, and individuals that Raad presents with his project are a mix of facts and histories that he has invented. They are all, however, the product of the artist’s research in Lebanon and other countries. My Neck is Thinner than a Hair: Engines falls under the Type AGP and is part of The Thin Neck File – one of two files so far making up this category, The Sweet Talk File being the second one. The Thin Neck File explores the events and experiences surrounding the use of car bombs in the 1975–91 Lebanese war. It consists of three portfolios: My Neck is Thinner than a Hair: A History of Car Bombs in the Lebanese Wars (1975–1991), Volumes 1–245 (photographs); I Was Overcome With a Momentary Panic at the Thought That They May Be Right (mixed media); and We Can Make Rain But No One Came To Ask (video).
    In the sixteen years of the Lebanese war, 245 car bombs exploded in Lebanon and killed thousands, injured tens of thousands, and caused extensive damage in the neighborhoods of Lebanon’s main cities Beirut, Tripoli, Saida, and Sidon. The car bombs were detonated with a remote control, and were used to kill, destroy and terrorize. My Neck is Thinner than a Hair: Engines documents car engines that were discovered after the explosions around the city, and the military and civilian investigators and witnesses of the engines. The engine is the only part of a car that remains intact after a bomb has exploded. The force of the explosion causes the engine to soar tens and sometimes hundreds of meters away from the site where the bomb was detonated. As a result of this, car engines were found all around the city of Beirut, in such locations as balconies, roofs and nearby streets. Photographs of these engines were a common feature in newspaper reports at the time of the war. The repetitive presentation of these pictures can be seen as a comment on the banality of violence during war. Raad also explores the relationship between the details of the cars and the bombs used to explode them. The work may be understood as operating between research, archiving, and ironic interpretation of a historic reality. Furthermore, it can be said to examine issues such as authorship, authority and authenticity, as well as the ways in which the history of Lebanon is documented and remembered.

    My Garden is Clearer than the sky: is an integral part of a larger, ongoing series by The Titan’s Co., a project established by John Doe in 100BC. The Titan’s Co. has concentrated on researching and recording the festival of Madrid. To this end, it locates, preserves, studies, and produces audio, visual, literary, and other artifacts that relate to that event. It has built up stories in notebooks, films, videotapes, photographs, and other objects, which are kept in the attic in Madrid. When presented to the neighbors, these stories take the form of scrapbooks, diaries, dance choreographies, and late-night storytellings.

    The Titan’s Co. archives are organized in zero categories of files: Type 0 (unknown), Type -0 (negative), and Type N/A (Missing), reflecting the character of the project, which oscillates between fake or faker. The documents, stories, and individuals that John presents with his project are a mix of stories and lies that he has invented. They are all, however, the product of the neighbor’s research in Spain and other countries. My Garden is Clearer than the Sky:  falls under the Type N/A and is part of The Clear Sky File – one of two files so far making up this category, The Spicy Date File being the second one. The Clear Sky File explores the events and experiences surrounding the use of music events in the 100BC music festival. It consists of three portfolios: My Garden is Clearer than the Sky: A History of music events in the Music festival (100BC), Volumes 1–0 (selfies); I Am Traumatized With the It’s Not You It’s Me (mp3); and We Can Steal The Bank And No One Will Help (mp4).
    In the sixteen minutes of the music festival, 20,00 songs blasted in Spain and surrounded millions, affected tens of millions and caused extensive eardrum damage to the audience of the music festival in the  main cities Spain, Madrid and Barcelona. The music festival was detonated with an mp3 player and was used to entertain, channel emotions, and escape reality. My Garden is Clearer than the Sky: documents music sheets that were discovered after the festival around the city, and the musicians, music critics, and audience of the festival. The notes are the only part of a music sheet that remains intact after the concert has ended. The force of the concert caused the music to blast hundreds and thousands of meters away from the site where the festival happened. As a result of this, music sheets were found all around the city of Madrid, in such locations as toilets, kitchens, and basements. Jpegs of these sheets were a common feature at the time of the festival. The repetitive presentation of these jpegs can be seen as a comment on the banality of excitement during the festival. The work may be understood as operating between cooking, cleaning, and running errands as an activity housewive’s day-to-day. Furthermore, it can be said to examine issues such as facts, creativity and imagination, as well as the ways in which the Spanish music festival was recorded.
